# CounterThingy
a small countert thingy i made, to make it easy on myself.

a small simple counter, which can add text before and after the numers you want, i have yet to make it so you can specify which number to begin from, and so on, but hey, it works, and its visuals can be customixed, and are saved in the exe file fro the program, which i will need to update, so it saves and reads them from a seperate file, so visuals are maintaned between updates.
